1) Run npm install

As there were 4 tasks I have created an array of 4 tasks
like

fileNames = ["task1", "task2", "task3", "task4"];


task1 => implementation with Core NodeJS

task2 => using async or step.js

task3 => using RSVP or Q

task4 => Bonus: with Bacon

so, to Run the code
use:

node server.js <taskNumber>  //  by default it will run only first task.

if you will add some wrong taskNumber still it will run only first task.
